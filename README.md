## What is the CIA Triad?

The CIA Triad is a widely respected model in the field of information security, guiding policies and procedures to protect data from unauthorized access and use. The triad consists of three fundamental principles:

## Confidentiality
  ***Prevents the unauthorized disclosure of data.***
  
  - **Data Encryption**: Scrambles data to make it unreadable by unauthroized personnel.
  - **Access Controls**: Identification, authentication, and authorization provide access controls and help ensure that only authorized personnel can access data.


## Integrity 

  ***Provides assurance the data has not changed.***

- **Hashing**: Using hash functions to ensure that data has not been tampered with. A change in the data, even a minor one, results in a completely different hash value.

## Availability

***Ensuring that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed.***

- **Redundancy/Fault Tolerance**: Adds duplication to critical systems and provides fault tolerance, eliminating single point of failures.
- **Scalability and Elasticity**: Allows systems to scale up by addidng additional hardware resources such as memory, processing power, bandwith capability, and/or drive space.
- **Patching**: Ensures systems stay up to date with the most current patches.

## Why is the CIA Triad Important?

The CIA Triad is crucial for protecting against cyber threats and ensuring the resilience of information systems. Adherence to these principles is not just a matter of technical security but is also of paramount importance for business continuity, reputation management, and legal compliance.

## Business Impact

- **Confidentiality Breaches**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data can lead to financial losses, legal repercussions, and damage to a company's reputation.
- **Integrity Violations**: Data tampering can result in flawed decision-making, disrupt business processes, and undermine trust in digital transactions.
- **Availability Disruptions**: Downtime or inaccessibility of critical systems can lead to operational interruptions, loss of revenue, and erosion of customer trust.

Incorporating the CIA Triad into business strategies and IT policies helps organizations protect their assets, maintain customer trust, and achieve competitive advantages in the marketplace.
