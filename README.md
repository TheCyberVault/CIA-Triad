   ## What is the CIA Triad?

The CIA Triad is a widely respected model in the field of information security, guiding policies and procedures to protect data from unauthorized access and use. The triad consists of three fundamental principles:

## Confidentiality
  ***Prevents the unauthorized disclosure of data.***
  
  - **Data Encryption**: Scrambles data to make it unreadable by unauthroized personnel.
  - **Access Controls**: Identification, authentication, and authorization provide access controls and help ensure that only authorized personnel can access data.


## Integrity 

  ***Provides assurance the data has not changed.***

- **Hashing**: Using hash functions to ensure that data has not been tampered with. A change in the data, even a minor one, results in a completely different hash value.

## Availability

***Ensuring that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed.***

- **Redundancy/Fault Tolerance**: Adds duplication to critical systems and provides fault tolerance, eliminating single point of failures.
- **Scalability and Elasticity**: Allows systems to scale up by addidng additional hardware resources such as memory, processing power, bandwith capability, and/or drive space.
- **Patching**: Ensures systems stay up to date with the most current patches.

Incorporating the CIA Triad into business strategies and IT policies helps organizations protect their assets, maintain customer trust, and achieve competitive advantages in the marketplace.
